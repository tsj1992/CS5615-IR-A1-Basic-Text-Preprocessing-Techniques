models have shown their promising opportunities for multitask\\nlearning which focus on learning the shared layers to extract the common and\\ntaskinvariant features however in most existing approaches the extracted shared\\nfeatures are prone to be contaminated by taskspecific features or the noise brought\\nby other tasks in this paper we propose an adversarial multitask learning framework\\nalleviating the shared and private latent feature spaces from interfering with\\neach other we conduct extensive experiments on  different text classification\\ntasks which demonstrates the benefits of our approach besides we show that the\\nshared knowledge learned by our proposed model can be regarded as offtheshelf\\nknowledge and easily transferred to new tasks\\n\\nmultitask learning is an effective approach to improve the performance of a single task with\\nthe help of other related tasks recently neuralbased models for multitask learning have become\\nvery popular ranging from computer vision misra et al  zhang et al  to natural\\nlanguage processing collobert andweston  luong et al  since they provide a convenient\\nway of combining information from multiple tasks\\nhowever most existing work on multitask learning liu et al cb attempts to divide the\\nfeatures of different tasks into private and shared spaces merely based on whether parameters of some components should be shared as shown in figure a the general sharedprivate model introduces\\ntwo feature spaces for any task one is used to store taskdependent features the other is\\nused to capture shared features the major limitation of this framework is that the shared feature\\nspace could contain some unnecessary taskspecific features while some sharable features\\ncould also be mixed in private space suffering from feature redundancy\\ntaking the following two sentences as examples which are extracted from two different sentiment\\nclassification tasks movie reviews and baby products reviews\\nthe infantile cart is simple and easy to use this kind of humour is infantile and boring\\nthe word �infantile� indicates negative sentiment in movie task while it is neutral in baby task\\nhowever the general sharedprivate model could place the taskspecific word �infantile� in a\\nshared space leaving potential hazards for other tasks additionally the capacity of shared space\\ncould also be wasted by some unnecessary features\\nto address this problem in this paper we propose an adversarial multitask framework in\\nwhich the shared and private feature spaces are in herently disjoint by introducing orthogonality constraintsspecifically we design a generic shared private learning framework to model the text sequence'"
