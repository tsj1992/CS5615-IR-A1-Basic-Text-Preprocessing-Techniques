** Student Course Feedback***

Honestly last seven lectures are good. Lectures are understandable. Lecture slides are very useful to self-study also. The given opportunity to ask questions from the lecturer is appreciative. 
"Good :) 
<br />please do recap at class starting it&#039;s better for us.
<br />sometimes teaching speed is very high.
<br />
<br />Thanks ! :)
<br /> "
The lectures are good..but a bit speed.A in class working activity is a must one.So please take another hour in thursdays madame.
"
<br />We can hear your voice clearly and can understand the things you teach. Presentation slides also good source to refer . lf you can do more example questions within the classroom and it will help us to understand the principles well. 
<br />"
Lectures was well structured and well organized. It was easy to understand. Lecture slides and labs were also well organized. 
Lectures were good. understandable. 
The lecture slides were well organized and the examples done in the class helped a lot to learn this new language and also the principles of OOP. Motivated to well. Would have been better if we discussed more about the solutions of coding exercisers.   
I think i learned a lot from the codes you write in the board. When i compare my codes with yours i can learn about my mistakes and good coding practices that i should follow. There fore i think it would be great if we can discuss more examples in the class.
madam explained  the oop concepts clearly with examples.lectures were interesting.we want more scenario examples and answers with explanations in future.
I satisfy about first 7 lectures. That way of teaching is really good for coming lectures too.
lectuers are very good. take good effort to make undersatand every student in the room. very helpfull. 
I was able to obtain a clear picture about OOP and its concepts. 
"lecture slides, explanations were very clear.
<br />it&#039;s very good to letting ask questions and explain again with suitable examples.
<br />sometimes, some codes on white board were unclear at the back.
<br />overall very good!!!
<br />"
The lectures were good and clear. And they weren&#039;t too fast. Writing code was somewhat confusing because I didn&#039;t know java before. 
Actually teaching is very good and can understand easily the concepts by examples which are given in the class.it will be more helpful if provide solved questions as well!. thankyou

@SweetnessShawnB Hes the POS that ramped up immigration for Canada, among other globalist policies.
Canada lifted visa requirements to Mexico as of Dec 1, 2016. Thoughts? #visa #immigration
@HuffingtonPost people Keep praising Canada and Canada has way stricter immigration laws then us they willl boot your liberal American ass

**research paper**
Neural network models have shown their promising opportunities for multi-task
learning, which focus on learning the shared layers to extract the common and
task-invariant features. However, in most existing approaches, the extracted shared
features are prone to be contaminated by task-specific features or the noise brought
by other tasks. In this paper, we propose an adversarial multi-task learning framework,
alleviating the shared and private latent feature spaces from interfering with
each other. We conduct extensive experiments on 16 different text classification
tasks, which demonstrates the benefits of our approach. Besides, we show that the
shared knowledge learned by our proposed model can be regarded as off-the-shelf
knowledge and easily transferred to new tasks.

Multi-task learning is an effective approach to improve the performance of a single task with
the help of other related tasks. Recently, neural-based models for multi-task learning have become
very popular, ranging from computer vision (Misra et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014) to natural
language processing (Collobert andWeston, 2008; Luong et al., 2015), since they provide a convenient
way of combining information from multiple tasks.
However, most existing work on multi-task learning (Liu et al., 2016c,b) attempts to divide the
features of different tasks into private and shared spaces, merely based on whether parameters of some components should be shared. As shown in Figure 1-(a), the general shared-private model introduces
two feature spaces for any task: one is used to store task-dependent features, the other is
used to capture shared features. The major limitation of this framework is that the shared feature
space could contain some unnecessary task-specific features, while some sharable features
could also be mixed in private space, suffering from feature redundancy.
Taking the following two sentences as examples, which are extracted from two different sentiment
classification tasks: Movie reviews and Baby products reviews.
The infantile cart is simple and easy to use. This kind of humour is infantile and boring.
The word �infantile� indicates negative sentiment in Movie task while it is neutral in Baby task.
However, the general shared-private model could place the task-specific word �infantile� in a
shared space, leaving potential hazards for other tasks. Additionally, the capacity of shared space
could also be wasted by some unnecessary features.
To address this problem, in this paper we propose an adversarial multi-task framework, in
which the shared and private feature spaces are in herently disjoint by introducing orthogonality constraints.Specifically, we design a generic shared private learning framework to model the text sequence.
