i
can

lecture
slides
explanations
were
very

br
its
very
good
to
letting
ask

br
sometimes
some
codes
on

were
unclear
at

br
overall
very
good
br
the
lectures
were
good
and
clear
and
they
werent
too
fast
writing

was
somewhat
confusing
because
i
didnt
know

before
actually
teaching
is
very
good
and
can
understand
easily
the

by

are

research
paper
neural
network
models
have
shown
their
promising
opportunities
for
multitask
learning
which
focus
on
learning
the
shared
layers
to
extract
the
common
and
taskinvariant
features
however
in
most
existing
approaches
the
extracted
shared
features
are
prone
to
be
contaminated
by
taskspecific
features
or
the
noise
brought
by
other
tasks
in
this
paper
we
propose
an
adversarial
multitask
learning
framework
alleviating
the
shared
and
private
latent
feature
spaces
from
interfering
with
each
other
we
conduct
extensive
experiments
on
different
text
classification
tasks
which
demonstrates
the
benefits
of
our
approach
besides
we
show
that
the
shared
knowledge
learned
by
our
proposed
model
can
be
regarded
as
offtheshelf
knowledge
and
easily
transferred
to
new
tasks
multitask
learning
is
an
effective
approach
to
improve
the
performance
of
a
single
task
with
the
help
of
other
related
tasks
recently
neuralbased
models
for
multitask
learning
have
become
very
popular
ranging
from
computer
vision
misra
et
al
zhang
et
al
to
natural
language
processing
collobert
andweston
luong
et
al
since
they
provide
a
convenient
way
of
combining
information
from
multiple
tasks
however
most
existing
work
on
multitask
learning
liu
et
al
cb
attempts
to
divide
the
features
of
different
tasks
into
private
and
shared
spaces
merely
based
on
whether
parameters
of
some
components
should
be
shared
as
shown
in
figure
a
the
general
sharedprivate
model
introduces
two
feature
spaces
for
any
task
one
is
used
to
store
taskdependent
features
the
other
is
used
to
capture
shared
features
the
major
limitation
of
this
framework
is
that
the
shared
feature
space
could
contain
some
unnecessary
taskspecific
features
while
some
sharable
features
could
also
be
mixed
in
private
space
suffering
from
feature
redundancy
taking
the
following
two
sentences
as
examples
which
are
extracted
from
two
different
sentiment
classification
tasks
movie
reviews
and
baby
products
reviews
the
infantile
cart
is
simple
and
easy
to
use
this
kind
of
humour
is
infantile
and
boring
the
word
�infantile�
indicates
negative
sentiment
in
movie
task
while
it
is
neutral
in
baby
task
however
the
general
sharedprivate
model
could
place
the
taskspecific
word
�infantile�
in
a
shared
space
leaving
potential
hazards
for
other
tasks
additionally
the
capacity
of
shared
space
could
also
be
wasted
by
some
unnecessary
features
to
address
this
problem
in
this
paper
we
propose
an
adversarial
multitask
framework
in
which
the
shared
and
private
feature
spaces
are
in
herently
disjoint
by
introducing
orthogonality
constraintsspecifically
we
design
a
